1. Corrected spelling of SATTELITE to SATELLITE.

1. Modified the application to utilize the GCTP library delivered with the
   HDF-EOS library, since that version of the GCTP library is now needed to
   link code with HDF-EOS.

1. Modified calibration of band 6 to flag the saturated thermal pixels in the
   output brightness temperature product.  This is consistent with flagging the
   saturated pixels in the reflective bands.
2. Modified lndcal to write the QA bits for the lndth product (brightness
   temperature product), including appropriate metadata for the QA band.  The
   QA bits include flags for both fill pixels and for saturated band 6 pixels,
   consistent with the QA bits for the reflective bands in the lndcal output.
3. Cleaned up some compiler warnings and minor bugs when freeing some of the
   data arrays.

1. removed production date rule in determining recalibration for TM data.
2. recalibration is now determined by RE_CAL flag (in lndcal*.txt) only 
   (default = flase)
3. load gnew and gold data only if RE_CAL=true (or yes)

1. fixed bugs that caused incompatible problems across different C compilers 
   for lndcal and lndsr (some variables need to be initilized first)
2. compiled and tested in 64-bit Linux system under 32-bit mode

4/17/2009   Feng Gao
1. fixed a bug in processing pixel with one or more band is missing 
   (uses fill value for all bands if one is missing) 
2. revised Makefile and forces code to be compiled in 32-bit (-m32) 
3. fixed a bug in using zero array in space.c 
   (can't be compiled for some compilers)

1. received original "lndcal" ledaps version from TK Lim and revised
   this version into two modes: public and ledaps
2. added option for re-calibration in "lndcal" input file
   do not run re-calibration (public mode) if RE_CAL="NO" or RE_CAL="FALSE"
   run re-calibration (default or ledaps mode) if RE_CAL="YES" or RE_CAL="TRUE"
3. added processing on saturated pixels (use 20000 as saturateValue)
4. used gain and bias from metedata as input for all sensors (MSS, TM, ETM+)
   under public mode (RE_CAL="NO"), otherwise run in ledaps mode as default.
