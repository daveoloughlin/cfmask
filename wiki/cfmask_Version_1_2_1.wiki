== Changes From Previous Version ==
====Updates on January XX, 2014 - USGS EROS====
  * CFmask 1.2.0 - Based on new Fmask v3.2 matlab code.
  * CFmask 1.2.1 - Code cleanup and memory usage enhancements.
    # Use a dynamic cloud over water threshold instead of a fixed value.
    # Remove the use of majority-filter functions on cloud pixels.
    # Remove the temperature screen for snow masking (because of omission of snow and this has also changed in MODIS C6).
    # Remove  the high probability test (because of constant false cloud masking).
    # Remove the opencv image_dilute function usage, instead using my self-implemented "image_dilate" which simulates the matlab image dilute used in Fmask code exactly. But my default "dilute_buffer" is 2*2+1 = 5 pixels instead of 2*3+1 = 7 pixels in Fmask.
    # Fixed a few bugs, couple of them are in Fmask matlab code and couple of them are in CFmask code.
