#summary Version 1.2.1 of the cfmask software.

== cfmask Version 1.2.1 Release Notes ==
Release Date: January XX, 2014

=== Downloads ===

* cfmask source code - available via the [http://code.google.com/p/cfmask/source/checkout cfmask Google Projects Source] link

  * Non-members may check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
  * svn checkout http://cfmask.googlecode.com/svn/cfmask/tags/version_1.2.1 cfmask-read-only 

=== Installation ===
  # Install dependent libraries - HDF-EOS GCTP, HDF4, HDF-EOS2
  # Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.  
{{{
    export HDFINC="path_to_HDF_include_files"
    export HDFLIB="path_to_HDF_libraries"
    export HDFEOS_INC="path_to_HDFEOS_include_files"
    export HDFEOS_LIB="path_to_HDFEOS_libraries"
    export HDFEOS_GCTPINC="path_to_HDFEOS_GCTP_include_files"
    export HDFEOS_GCTPLIB="path_to_HDFEOS_GCTP_libraries"
    export ESUN="path_to_EarthSunDistance.txt_file"
}}}
  # Checkout (from Google cfmask project) and install source files
{{{
cd cfmask/src
make
make install
}}}
This will create an cfmask executable under $BIN(tested in gcc  compiler)

  #: Test - Obtain a lndth.hdf file, a lndcal file, and a metadata file (from LEDAPS) then run the following command
{{{
cfmask --metadata=input_metadata_filename_with_full_path
}}}
  #: Check output
{{{
fmask.<scene_name>.hdf: should contain only one fmask_band in the HDF output file
}}}

=== Dependencies ===
  * GCTP libraries
  * HDF4 libraries
  * HDF-EOS2 libraries
  * Python 2.7 and Scipy 

=== Associated Scripts ===
Same scripts as for Version 1.1.1, updated for 1.2.1.

=== Verification Data ===

== Changes From Previous Version ==
====Updates on January XX, 2014 - USGS EROS====

  * CFmask 1.2.0 - Based on new Fmask v3.2 matlab code.
    # Removed usage of openCV image_dilute routine.
    # Use a dynamic cloud over water threshold instead of a fixed value.
    # Remove the use of majority-filter functions on cloud pixels.
    # Remove the temperature screen for snow masking (because of omission of snow and this has also changed in MODIS C6).
    # Remove  the high probability test (because of constant false cloud masking).
    # Remove the opencv image_dilute function usage, instead using my self-implemented "image_dilate" which simulates the matlab image dilute used in Fmask code exactly. But my default "dilute_buffer" is 2*2+1 = 5 pixels instead of 2*3+1 = 7 pixels in Fmask.
    # Fixed a few bugs, couple of them are in Fmask matlab code and couple of them are in CFmask code. 
  * CFmask 1.2.1 - Code cleanup and memory usage enhancements.
    # Minor update to scripts for memory usage.
    # Updates to source for memory usage.
